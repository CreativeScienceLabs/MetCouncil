                                <p>In March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic, New York City was faced with an unprecedented surge in demand for emergency food, prompting the launch of <strong>GetFoodNYC</strong>. This program aimed to deliver food to elderly, infirm and other homebound New Yorkers who were most at risk of COVID-19. </p>

                                <p>The City kept track of <strong>GetFoodNYC</strong> requests and for the first time, shared the data publicly to allow for an opportunity to examine citywide demand for food by category (kosher, halal, vegetarian, latin, pan-asian and Non-Specialty), as well as by zip code.</p>

GetFoodNYC delivered food to elderly, infirm, and other homebound New Yorkers who were most at risk of death and illness from COVID-19.</p>

                                        <p>The program adapted swiftly to widespread demand, and over time introduced alternatives that were responsive to cultural needs including kosher, halal, vegetarian, Latin, and pan-Asian food options.</p>

                                        <p>From the program’s inception through the end of September 2021, GetFoodNYC delivered 128.7 million meals, helping feed vulnerable, food insecure New Yorkers and enabling them to remain safe in their homes.1 The data tracked by the program offer a first-time opportunity to examine citywide demand for food by category (kosher, halal, vegetarian, Latin, pan-Asian, and non-specialty) as well as by ZIP code.

For the purposes of this report, all data and metrics related to GetFoodNYC as reported by the City of New York will be referred to as either “meals distributed” or “meals.” This is the term used by the City of New York on the website (above) that hosts all GetFoodNYC data. We believe these to be individual counts of meals that were part of distributions of food boxes or similar packages that contained nine individual meals per box.2 Of the top ten ZIP codes receiving kosher food and the top ten ZIP codes receiving halal food, eight were in Brooklyn (of which two were on both the kosher and halal top ten lists), five were in Queens, and five were in the Bronx. 1 parameters offered by the GetFoodNYC program.</p>

                                        <p>In addition, delivery of food on Saturdays (the Jewish Sabbath) or Jewish holidays caused some kosher-observant households to either withdraw from the program or feel uncomfortable with participating. The data does not enable us to quantify these populations. Nevertheless, the City of New York’s efforts to make sure no one went hungry likely enabled many kosher- and halal-observant individuals to receive emergency food for the first time.</p>
                                        <p>Although one in five New Yorkers enrolled in the program requested kosher or halal food, the City’s emergency feeding system only has a limited number of providers with the expertise and experience to provide food that adheres to religious dietary requirements and is culturally appropriate. We must ensure that New York’s emergency feeding system recognizes and addresses the diverse dietary needs and requirements of all food insecure New Yorkers and is prepared for the next crisis.</p>

                                <p>For the purposes of this analysis, we looked at this data in several different ways. First, we segmented the data by month covering every month from April of 2020, the first month in which culturally responsive meals were made available, to July of 2021, the latest full month of publicly available data at the time of our analysis. Once broken into individual months we separated out the total monthly requests for all meals, kosher meals, and halal meals by zip code.
