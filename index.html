                                        and illness from COVID-19. Over time the program adapted to include culturally
                                        responsive food including kosher, halal, vegetarian, Latin, and pan-Asian

                                            2020, June was the month with the highest demand for GetFoodNYC meals.
                                            Kosher
                                            and halal meals made up <strong>23 percent</strong> of the meals distributed
                                            that month. While
                                            the total number of meals distributed starts to decline after June 2020, the
                                            demand for kosher and halal meals does not. It holds steady and even rises
                                            slightly through September 2020.</p>

                                        essential to understand the broad range
                                        of cultural differences and specific needs of neighborhoods across the City when
                                        providing emergency food to communities with specific dietary requirements such
                                        as kosher and halal. </p>
                                    <p>These numbers could underestimate the need for kosher and halal food, since some
                                        communities of kosher- and halal-observant New Yorkers could not participate in
                                        the program because they require elevated levels of certification that
                                        GetFoodNYC did not meet. Moreover, delivery of food on Saturdays (the Jewish
                                        Sabbath) or Jewish holidays caused some kosher-observant households to withdraw
                                        from the program and others not to enroll at all. For instance, the GetFoodNYC
                                        data
                                        shows lower than expected program uptake in Williamsburg even though there is a
                                        large population of low-income ultra-Orthodox households in this neighborhood.

                                    <p>Nevertheless, the City’s efforts to make sure no one went hungry likely enabled
                                        many kosher- and halal-observant individuals to receive emergency food for the
                                        first time. </p>
